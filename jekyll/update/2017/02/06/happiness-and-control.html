    <p>The other day, my British Literature professor likened going to the bars and going to Church as more or less the same thing. He argued that when you go to Church, you want to experience spirituality by praying to God, and that when you go to the bars you want to experience a pause from sobriety – but it is that desire to experience change that is constant. He continued on to explain that people only do things because they desire change, and that if you boil down all human decision making, it comes down to a decision made either in fear or in desire. 
Incidentally, George Soros agrees with him, so I think my professor is in good company. Soros once said (this is paraphrased) that: “the only two motivators to make money is either fear or greed (desire). I grew up in abject poverty, and I am so deeply scared of being poor again that I will forever try to make more money”.</p>

<p>Fear or desire.</p>

<p>So we make decisions every single day, and every single one of those decisions come from either fear of x, or desire for y.</p>

<p>First, does it even matter if your decisions are driven by fear or by desire? They both sound bad (where is ~logic~?)</p>

<p>It turns out that it does. In freshman year I took a class called Multicultural Living in America. It was through the Kinesiology department, and it was 10 weeks where I learned about the impacts of cultural upbringing and socioeconomic factors on human health. The single biggest takeaway hammered into our heads was that stress -&gt; elevated cortisol production -&gt; you die young after heart and other cardiovascular complications. Cortisol is the hormone most attributed to your fight-or-flight adrenaline-infused mode, and it turns out that the human body can’t take too many doses of that drug. The class was a massive case study on white people vs. black people, and the second biggest takeaway was that the reason black people die younger than white people (across the board, adjusted for other reasons, very statistically significantly) is because they are experiencing more stress because they feel less in control of their lives. [1] It’s not just the more stress -&gt; cortisol -&gt; death at a younger age chain-of-events that is troubling though, because the feeling less in control actually brings a whole host of problems. We spent a couple lectures in that class learning about anxiety, depression, eating disorders, chronic fatigue, and a whole host of other problems that feeling less in control begets.</p>

<p>So you die young, but before you die young, your life sucks. You’re sub-optimal mentally, you’re having less deeply restorative sleep (and less of it) so you’re tired all the time and sub-optimal physically, and it has even been proven to reduce optimism. All because you don’t feel in control.</p>

<p>It seems so simple. Take back control, and you’ll live a great life! You’ll be happy and energetic and hopeful and best of all, you’ll live a long life!</p>

<p>How do you do it?</p>

<p>You can start (and it really is only just a start) by examining again the dichotomy my literature professor explained. He argued that all the decisions we make in life are governed by either fear or desire, and he set it up as a mutually exclusive statement (that is – a decision is made either in fear, or in desire). He’s right, but it turns out that fear and desire are just two halves of the same exact coin – and that any decision made in fear can just as equally be made in desire (and actually IS, and we just have to acknowledge that).</p>

<p>Here’s the thing. We react to external stimuli badly. A professor assigns a test (oh man, I have to study). A professor schedules a senior project meeting (I have to go to campus). A boyfriend or girlfriend gives you an ultimatum in an argument (I have to compromise)! In all of these situations, we see someone doing something TO us, and that mental frame-of-mind of someone else doing something to us takes the control and power out of our own hands. When you feel like you don’t have control and power, suddenly all the bad things happen.</p>

<p>First a disclaimer: it is impossible to avoid these situations. Even if you’re not in college and have never been in a relationship, there are code reviews in industry, managers, friends, utilities to pay, or some guy in line at the bus stop who shoves you. Forget trying to get control back by eliminating situations where you interact with other people and where they do things TO you. It is also not a good idea to try to wall yourself off from getting hurt by becoming emotionally unattached/unavailable – no man is an island and the cracks will show up eventually and you’ll be back to square one (believe me on this one – I once tried).</p>

<p>Now think about decisions that you’ve made that have come out of desire. Starting taking singing lessons because I wanted to sing. Started cooking at home because I wanted to be healthy. Stopped cooking at home because I wanted to be lazy. Reaching out to a friend because I wanted to reconnect with them. Intentionally letting a call go to voicemail because I didn’t want to ruin my flow as I was typing this blog post. All of these decisions gave me pleasure and happiness, because they were all in my control and I desired something. They were internally driven decisions.</p>

<p>Look back at all the examples where other people do stuff TO us. Those are stressful, and whatever decision we made (studying, going to school, accepting an ultimatum, etc.) were all done out of fear/lack of control, and we overall feel not-good. Those are all externally driven decisions.</p>

<p>So decisions made out of fear are decisions that are externally driven (people doing stuff TO us), and decisions made out of desire are internally driven (I want something).</p>

<p>The answer isn’t to change a single thing about your lifestyle. It’s only to change how you process the external stimuli (and to continually be thoughtful).</p>

<p>Let’s take the studying example.</p>

<ul>
<li>I think I'm studying for the test because I have to.</li>
<i>But why do I have to?</i>
<li>Well it's because I am afraid of failing the class if I don't. </li>
<i>But why am I afraid of failing the class?</i>
<li>Because I'm afraid of not getting my degree if I don't.</li>
<i>Why am I afraid of that?</i>
<li>Because I am afraid of not living up to my parent's expectations.</li>
<i>Why?</i>
<li>Because I look up to my parents and I am afraid of their disappointment.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can go as far down this rabbit hole as you want, and you can for any of the externally-driven, stressful situations/decisions, and you’ll find that there’s a chain of fear/lack of control that culminates in a decision made grudgingly, unhappily, and adding to your cortisol production.</p>

<p>Some people here say, “Just drop out!” but as I explained above, avoiding situations where people do things TO you is impossible because those situations will always exist, so let’s try something else.</p>

<p>Fear and desire are two halves of the same coin, so lets just apply desire to the same situation (and come back up the rabbit hole).</p>

<ul>
   <li>I look up to my parents and I want their approval.</li>
   <li>I want to live up to my parents’ expectations by getting a degree from a university.</li>
   <li>I want to get a get a degree from a university by passing all the required classes.</li>
   <li>I want to pass this required class by studying for my test. </li>
   <li>Oh. That's why I'm studying for this test.</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems a little silly that all it takes is you telling yourself that you’re doing something because you “want” to do it instead of you “have” to do it, but I promise it works. Ever since my professor mentioned this concept of all decisions are made as a desire for change and all change is motivated by either desire or fear, I’ve been actively trying to remind myself that everything I do, I do because I want to do it and not because someone is forcing me to do it.</p>

<p>This works for big things like code reviews for my senior project but also little things like my roommate telling me to take the trash out (I want to do it because I want to maintain the integrity of the chore chart because I want to invest in our great roommate dynamic because I want to preserve my quality-of-life).</p>

<p>I’ve been a lot happier since I’ve started internalizing external things people do TO me (note though that you really have to constantly think and reflect on why you WANT to be doing something, because sometimes the deeper meaning that actually provides control and peace isn’t immediately self-evident – so it can be exhausting at times to search your brain).</p>

<p>So take back happiness, by taking back control over every single decision in your life (and you don’t even have to change anything about the way you live!)</p>

<p>[1] 
It is important to note here that black people across America aren’t just mysteriously and magically feeling “out of control” without justification; there are actually a large number of reasons why they consistently feel this way ranging from volume levels of surroundings while trying to sleep (denser housing units) to the shortage of grocery stores and abundance of fast food restaurants in neighborhoods with primary black communities (harder to feed your children balanced meals), etc. If you are more interested in this, I still have my textbooks from freshman year from this class.</p>
